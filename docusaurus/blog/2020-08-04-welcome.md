We got a brand new site for Keuss, powered by [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io). Chances are, if you're reading this, you already found the site...

Good old README.md, as simple and convenient as it is, was becoming way too big and difficult to navigate. Also, it is not a proper site worth presenting to the world; hence the decision to add a small, simple enough site to Keuss
