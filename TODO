* signal queue creation or read queues on refresh?
* bridges?
* queue traversal/query
* priorities?
* add factory archetypes (all-mongo, all-mongo-bucket...)
* pipelines
  + add some commonplace transforms (etl-like)
  + create a server for that, allow processor code defined externally
+ more and better examples
+ remove elements from queue by id
* add headers as sibling to payload
